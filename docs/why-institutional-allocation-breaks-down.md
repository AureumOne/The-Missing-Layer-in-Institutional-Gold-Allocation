# Why Institutional Allocation Breaks Down

In institutional environments, decisions must not only be correct —  
they must be **defensible**.

Defensible before outcomes.  
Defensible to third parties.  
Defensible within structures that outlast individuals.

This is where gold repeatedly fails.

Not due to volatility.  
Not due to liquidity.  
But because its inclusion demands answers that fall outside the asset itself:

- Who is responsible for what?  
- Where does fiduciary duty end and operational responsibility begin?  
- What evidence exists — and for whom — over time?  
- How can one prove that no additional exposure was assumed?

Confronted with these questions, gold ceases to be an asset  
and becomes a structural exception.

And exceptions do not survive committees.

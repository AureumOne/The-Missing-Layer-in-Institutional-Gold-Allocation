# Aureum's Role (Deliberately Narrow)

Aureum exists solely to operate this missing layer.

Nothing more.

It does not define investment strategy.  
It does not hold client assets.  
It does not act as custodian, broker, or financial intermediary.

Its role is strictly institutional:  
to build and maintain an infrastructure that allows physical gold  
to be integrated into institutional environments  
with explicit governance, functional segregation, and verifiable evidence.

Aureum does not solve the "gold case".  
It removes the structural anomaly that has always prevented the case from existing.

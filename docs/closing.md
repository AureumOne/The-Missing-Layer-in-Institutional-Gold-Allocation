# Closing — Naming the Thing

Gold never failed as an asset.  
It failed as an institution.

As long as this distinction remains unrecognized,  
the debate repeats itself — always with the same limits,  
always with the same frictions.

This document does not propose a conclusion.  
It simply names something that has always been present.

And once named,  
it ceases to be invisible.

# Reading Contract

This document is not an argument in favor of gold.  
It is not an investment thesis.  
It is not a product proposal, structure, or return discussion.

This text exists for a specific reader:  
someone who already understands **why gold makes sense**,  
and who has also experienced **why it consistently fails to sustain itself institutionally**.

If you have never had to defend gold before a committee,  
if you have never been required to explain responsibility, evidence, operational boundaries, or governance,  
this document will likely not be useful.

Nothing here seeks agreement.  
Nothing here requests a decision.

Its sole purpose is to name, with technical precision,  
a structural gap that has always existed —  
but has rarely been treated as such.

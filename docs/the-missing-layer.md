# The Missing Layer

Between physical gold and institutional decision-making,  
there exists a layer that has never been formally built.

It is not custody.  
It is not distribution.  
It is not a financial product.

It is an **intermediate institutional layer**, responsible for:

- defining explicit boundaries  
- separating incompatible functions  
- generating continuous evidence  
- making responsibility observable

In the absence of this layer, gold reaches decision-making bodies "raw" —  
carrying risks that do not originate in the asset,  
but in the void surrounding it.

That void has never been treated as an architectural problem.  
It has always been treated as a peculiarity of gold.

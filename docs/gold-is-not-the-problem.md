# Gold Is Not the Problem

From an economic perspective, gold is trivial to understand.

Store of value, intertemporal protection, real asset with no credit risk.  
These arguments are well known, repeatedly articulated, and broadly accepted.

Gold's failure within institutional contexts **does not stem from ignorance**  
nor from relevant macroeconomic objections.

When gold is rejected, it is not rejected for lack of rationality,  
but for excess responsibility.

The problem is not the asset.  
It lies in what happens *before* and *after* it.

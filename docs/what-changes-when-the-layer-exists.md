# What Changes When the Layer Exists

When this layer exists, a fundamental shift occurs.

Gold ceases to be an exception that must be justified  
and becomes a component that can be **framed**.

The discussion moves away from "do we believe in it?"  
toward "is it bounded, evidenced, and governed?".

Allocation no longer depends on individual conviction  
but on the robustness of the structure.

This is not about making gold attractive.  
It is about making it **institutionally possible**.
